# 100 Days Of Code - Log 

## Day 1: March 15, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Today was about learning how to use and navigate the Replit IDE and workspace. I covered some common coding problems in Python and wrote my very first statement - the print statement.

**Thoughts:**  I began the challenge and also wrote my first python code. It was a great feeling.  

**Any challenges I encountered:** There was no major challenge on day 1. Everything worked out super dope.

I am signing up for Replit's 100 days of Python challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do this from my phone wherever I happen to be. No excuses for not coding from the middle of a field!

## Day 21: March 1, Thursday 

**Today's Progress:** Day two -  learning how to take input from users and return them. The input() function takes input from the user, store them in the console, wait until the user type someting and returns it. These inputs or data can be store using variable. You can give varibale any name, but you can't use space. 

**Thoughts:**  On every step of the way, it's important to consider common errors and how to fix. I was able to learn about Python Syntax and Name errors. Syntax error occurs when the interpreter encounters invalid syntax in code and Name error occurs when you try to use a variable, function, or module that doesn't exist or wasn't used in a valid way.

**Any challenges I encountered:** There was no major challenge on day 2 too. Everything seemes to be working out super dope.
