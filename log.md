# 100 Days Of Code - Log 

## Day 1: March 15, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Today was about learning how to use and navigate the Replit IDE and workspace. I covered some common coding problems in Python and wrote my very first statement - the print system.

**Thoughts:**  I began the challenge and also wrote my first python code. It was a great feeling.  

**Any challenges I encountered:** There was no major challenge on day 1. Everything worked out super dope.

I am signing up for Replit's 100 days of Python challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do this from my phone wherever I happen to be. No excuses for not coding from the middle of a field!
