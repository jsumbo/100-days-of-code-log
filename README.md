# 100-days-of-code-log
Welcome to my 100 Days of Python Challenge repository! Over the next 100 days, I will be documenting my progress as I learn and practice Python in this [log](https://github.com/jsumbo/100-days-of-code-log/blob/main/log.md).

## About the Challenge
The 100 Days of Code Challenge is an initiative that encourages people to commit to coding for at least an hour every day for 100 days straight. This challenge is a great way to build discipline, establish good coding habits, and make meaningful progress towards your coding goals.

## Daily Progress
Each day, I will update this repository with a log of my progress, including:

- What I worked on
- What I learned
- Any challenges I encountered
- Code snippets or screenshots of my work

## Follow Along
If you're interested in following along with my journey, feel free to fork this repository or follow me on [Replit](https://replit.com/@ultraflourine). Let's learn and grow together!
